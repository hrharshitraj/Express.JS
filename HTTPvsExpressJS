Difference between HTTP module and Express.js module:
                HTTP                                                                                                Express
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP comes inbuilt along with NodeJS that is,                                         Express is installed explicitly using npm command: npm install express 
we don’t need to install it explicitly. 	

HTTP is not a framework as a whole, rather it is just a module.	                      Express is a framework as a whole.

HTTP does not provide function for static hosting,                                    Express provide express.static function for static asset hosting. Example: app.use(express.static(‘public’));
you require to write your own.	

HTTP is an independent module.	                                                      Express is made on top of the HTTP module.

HTTP module provides various tools (functions) to do things                           Express along with what HTTP does provide many more functions in order to make development easy.
for networking like making a server, client, etc.
